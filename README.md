## Introduction 📚✨
Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction** project! This exciting initiative uses the power of machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. By analyzing features like age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, we aim to assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Let's make healthcare smarter together! 🌟

## Installation ⚙️🛠️
Get your environment set up and running with these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chiku-26/Diabetes-Prediction.git
   cd Diabetes-Prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

You're all set! 🎉

## Usage 🚀🔍
Ready to predict? Run the `Diabetes.ipynb` script to get started:

```sh
python main.py
```

This will preprocess the data, train the model, and give you the predictions! 🧠✨

## Model Description 🧠💡
Our model pipeline is built with the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables. 🔄
2. **Model Training**: Training the model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. 🏋️‍♂️
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 📈

## Datasets 📊🔬
We use the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which includes the following features:
- Pregnancies 🤰
- Glucose 🍬
- Blood Pressure 💉
- Skin Thickness 📏
- Insulin 💉
- BMI ⚖️
- Diabetes Pedigree Function 🧬
- Age 🎂
- Outcome (target variable) ✅

## Results 🏅🎯
Our model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are available in the `Jupyter Notebook` directory. 📈✨

## Contributing 🤝🌍
We welcome contributions from everyone! If you have suggestions for improvements or find any bugs, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's collaborate and make this project even better! 🎉
